# SemantiStore

SemantiStore is a web application designed to enable semantic search in large collections of documents. This project leverages advanced vector search techniques to retrieve relevant documents based on the meaning behind user queries, rather than simple keyword matching.

- **Database_interface.py**: This file contains the `DatabaseInterface` class, which manages connections to the MongoDB and Pinecone databases, as well as document querying and uploading operations.
- **FileTextLoader.py**: This file contains the `FileTextLoader` class, responsible for handling file uploads and storing documents in the database in various formats (txt, doc, docx, pdf).

## Installation
